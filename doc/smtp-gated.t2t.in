= NAME =

**smtp-gated** - transparently block viruses during SMTP connections

= VERSION =

This manual describes smtp-gated v. @VERSION@

= SYNOPSIS =

**smtp-gated** [-f] [ -h | -s | -S | -r | -t | -T | -v | -V ] config_file

= DESCRIPTION =

**smtp-gated** checks SMTP traffic and blocks any viruses found.
It can also spam-check messages. E-mail containing virus is blocked
(SMTP-server session is brought down), and a proper message is sent
to client software. E-mails found to be a SPAM, can also be blocked,
or just the fact is logged.

**smtp-gated** uses netfilter framework to forward connections to destination
MTA. It's meant to be transparent, so any SMTP-authentication works ok.
Also pipelining extension is supported.

Daemonised scanning engines support is integrated, so there is minimal
performance hit on scanning.

= CONFIGURATION =

Configuration is done with config_file. There is no default path for it.
If you would like to create configuration template, see **-t** option:

	smtp-gated -t | sed -e 's/^[a-z]/;&/' >/etc/smtp-gated.conf

To make upgrades easier, be sure not to uncomment unneccesary options.

= OPTIONS =

Options marked with //CONFIG// require config file on command line. For others,
no config file means default configuration.

: **-C name** [CONFIG]
show value for configuration variable "name"
: **-f**
run foreground, use for debugging
: **-h**
command reference
: **-K** [CONFIG]
kill running process (TERM in SIGNALS)
: **-s** [CONFIG]
prepare & show process status (USR1 in SIGNALS)
: **-S** [CONFIG]
prepare & show process status file name
: **-r** [CONFIG]
reload configuration (HUP in SIGNALS)
: **-t**
syntax check & dump configuration (except messages)
: **-T** [CONFIG]
syntax check & dump configuration (including messages)
: **-v**
show version
: **-V**
show version & compiled-in options
: **config_file**
required for most commands, except **-t** and **-T**.


= SIGNALS =

: **HUP**
reload configuration
: **USR1**
dump statistics (see -s in OPTIONS)
: **TERM**
close server socket and wait for existing sessions to finish.
: **QUIT**
same as above


= RELAYING =

Listening port __MUST__ be protected from world-access or proxy will
act as open-relay. This can be achieved either by setting bind_address
to internal IP, or by denying listen-port access from outside world
using iptables.


= STATUS =

You can request status dump, by using //smtp-gated -s config_file// or by
sending SIGUSR1 to daemon process. This will write status to the //statusfile//.

It will contain the following (may change in further versions):
: **Start time: Thu Mar 3 17:06:21 2005**
daemon start time
: **Restart time: Tue Mar 15 14:34:41 2005**
daemon last SIGHUP time
: **Uptime: 11d 21h 28m 22s**
time since 'Start time'
: **Found: 43/0 (viruses/spam)**
number of [viruses/spam] found so far; this *does not count* any virus/spam avoided with client-lock (see: Rejects: lock)
: **Children: 1/18 (current/max)**
current/maximum number of user sessions
: **Requests: 25238/113/7506 (total/direct/empty)**
total number of sessions/direct (=TLS) sessions/empty sessions (=without transaction).
: **Rejects: 0/458/10421/0 (host/ident/lock/other)**
Rejected requests; because of per-host-limit/per-ident-limit/client-locked/other reason.


Next, current running sessions:

: **slot**
internal connection table client slot
: **pid**
serving process ID
: **state**
SMTP session state
: **flags**
session flags:
	AUTH: a=supported, A=accepted
: **time**
session running time
: **source**
source (client) IP
: **target**
destination (server/MTA) IP 
: **trns**
number of current transaction
: **cli_rx**
client-received byte count
: **srv_rx**
server-received byte count
: **kbps**
average speed (since connection started) in kbits/second
: **ident**
client ident*
